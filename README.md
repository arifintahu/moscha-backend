# Moscha - Chatbot for Cosmos Chains

## Overview

Moscha is an interactive chatbot designed specifically for engaging with Cosmos chains. Our primary objective is to provide seamless and meaningful interactions for users.

As a solution, we enable users to execute transactions and seek assistance through the chatbot.
